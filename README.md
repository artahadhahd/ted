# Ted: the text editor made in a week
Ted is a fully functioning text editor that just works. It's currently a proof of concept and the work is still in progress. `ted` is only available on Linux at the moment, as there are no viable `ncurses` alternatives on Windows. No UTF-8 characters supported yet.

# Usage
```
ted <file>
```
